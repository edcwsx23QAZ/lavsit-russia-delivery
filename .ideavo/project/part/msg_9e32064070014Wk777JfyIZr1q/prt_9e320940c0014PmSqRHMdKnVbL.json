  "text": "## Conversation Summary: Freight Calculator Application Development\n\n### What Was Done:\n1. **Initial Setup & Planning**: Created a comprehensive todo list covering all major enhancements (robust error handling, performance monitoring, testing infrastructure, UI/UX redesign, mobile optimization, external API integration, monitoring/logging system).\n2. **Robust Error Handling Implementation**: \n   - Built centralized error management system in `lib/error-handling.ts` with error categorization, retry logic, user-friendly messages, and result caching\n   - Created `components/ErrorFallback.tsx` for graceful error UI display\n   - Enhanced API utilities in `lib/api-utils.ts` with `enhancedApiRequest` function\n   - Updated `app/page.tsx` to use enhanced error handling for Dellin API calculations\n\n### What Is Currently Being Worked On:\n- **Completing Robust Error Handling**: Integrating the new error handling system across all transport company API calls in the main calculator\n- **Moving to Performance Monitoring**: Next priority task after error handling is complete\n\n### Which Files Are Being Modified:\n- **Core Error Handling**: `lib/error-handling.ts`, `lib/api-utils.ts`, `components/ErrorFallback.tsx`\n- **Main Calculator**: `app/page.tsx` (updating API calls to use enhanced error handling)\n- **Diagnostic Page**: `app/diagnostic/page.tsx` and related components (for monitoring and testing infrastructure)\n\n### What Needs to Be Done Next:\n1. **Complete Error Handling Integration**: Update all remaining transport company calculation functions (PEK, Vozovoz, Rail Continent, Nord Wheel, SDEK, KIT) to use `enhancedApiRequest` with proper error handling\n2. **Performance Monitoring**: Integrate Sentry for error tracking, Web Vitals for performance metrics, and APM monitoring\n3. **Testing Infrastructure**: Set up Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress, MSW for comprehensive testing suite on Diagnostics page\n4. **UI/UX Enhancement**: Implement modern design system, micro-interactions, dark theme, and PWA capabilities\n5. **Remaining Tasks**: Mobile responsiveness, external API integration, and monitoring/logging system completion\n\nAll monitoring and testing infrastructure will be consolidated in the Diagnostics page as specified. The application is being built with production-ready code, security best practices, and scalable architecture.",
