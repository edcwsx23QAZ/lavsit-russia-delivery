  "text": "## Conversation Summary\n\n### What Was Done\n- **Reorganized TruckVisualization component layout** from single-column to two-column design\n- **Moved 3D visualization to the right side** alongside calculation results on the left\n- **Enhanced visual styling** with emojis, better section headers, and improved cargo legend formatting\n\n### File Modified\n- `/home/user/project/components/TruckVisualization.tsx` - Complete CardContent layout restructure using `xl:grid-cols-2`\n\n### Current Layout Structure\n**Left Column:**\n- Statistics section (occupied dimensions, utilization metrics)\n- Enhanced cargo legend with color coding and detailed information\n\n**Right Column:**\n- 3D controls panel (joystick, rotation sliders, reset button)\n- Interactive 3D SVG visualization with truck model and cargo placement\n\n### Key Improvements\n- **Better UX**: Side-by-side viewing of results and 3D model\n- **Logical organization**: Calculation results separated from interactive visualization\n- **Visual enhancements**: Dark theme consistency, emojis, improved typography\n- **Responsive design**: Grid layout that stacks on smaller screens\n\n### Current State\nThe component now has a professional two-column layout that allows users to view statistics while interacting with the 3D visualization simultaneously. The reorganization is complete and functional.\n\n### Ready for Next Steps\nThe layout foundation is solid for potential future enhancements like:\n- Additional 3D features or animations\n- More detailed statistics or metrics\n- Enhanced interactivity or controls\n- Performance optimizations",
