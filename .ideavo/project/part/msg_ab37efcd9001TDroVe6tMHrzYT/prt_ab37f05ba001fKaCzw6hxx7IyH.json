  "text": "\nI can see the structure looks correct. Let me try a different approach. Since the error is consistently pointing to the JSX structure, let me check if there's a missing opening parenthesis or brace in the JSX structure itself. \n\nThe error \"Expected jsx identifier\" when encountering `div` suggests that the parser thinks it should be seeing something else (like a variable name or component name) instead of a JSX element. This often happens when there's an unmatched opening parenthesis or brace from a conditional or function call.\n\nLet me check if there are any unmatched parentheses in the JSX by examining the area around the return statement more carefully. Let me look at the exact structure around the return statement:",
