  "text": "\nNow I can see the issue more clearly! At line 19 there's `)}` and at line 20 there's `)}`. The first `)}` at line 19 correctly closes the conditional that started at line 3. But the second `)}` at line 20 is extra and doesn't have a matching opening.\n\nHowever, the TypeScript error is still pointing to these lines, which suggests there might be a structural issue earlier. Let me check what the conditional at line 5061 should be matching. The error says \" ')' expected\" at line 5061, which suggests there's a missing opening parenthesis somewhere.\n\nLet me check the structure before line 5061 to see if there's an unmatched opening:",
