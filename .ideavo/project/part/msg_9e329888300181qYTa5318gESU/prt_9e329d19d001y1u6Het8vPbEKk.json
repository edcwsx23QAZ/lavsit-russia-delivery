  "text": "## Conversation Summary: Freight Calculator Application Development\n\n### What Was Done:\n1. **Enhanced Error Handling Integration**: Updated all transport company calculation functions (PEK, Vozovoz, Rail Continent, Nord Wheel, CDEK, KIT) to use `enhancedApiRequest` with comprehensive error handling, retry logic, and caching\n2. **Performance Monitoring**: \n   - Integrated Sentry for error tracking and APM monitoring (already configured in sentry.client.config.js and sentry.server.config.js)\n   - Added Web Vitals monitoring in `components/ClientDevUtils.tsx` for Core Web Vitals (CLS, FID, FCP, LCP, TTFB) with Google Analytics integration\n3. **Testing Infrastructure**: Set up comprehensive testing in Diagnostics page with `components/diagnostic/TestRunner.tsx`, API testing scripts, and `/api/run-tests` endpoint for standalone test execution\n4. **Code Quality Fixes**: Removed JSX components from `lib/error-handling.ts` to fix TypeScript compilation errors\n\n### What Is Currently Being Worked On:\n- **Fixing Compilation Errors**: Resolving remaining TypeScript build failures\n\n### Which Files Are Being Modified:\n- **`lib/error-handling.ts`**: Removed JSX ErrorBoundary component to fix compilation\n- **`app/page.tsx`**: Added `enhancedApiRequest` calls to all calculation functions and fixed variable scope issues\n- **`components/ClientDevUtils.tsx`**: Added Web Vitals monitoring integration\n\n### What Needs To Be Done Next:\n1. **Fix Remaining TypeScript Error**: Resolve the `requestData` scope issue at line 644 in `app/page.tsx` (appears to be in the Nord Wheel calculation function error handling)\n2. **Complete Build Verification**: Ensure the application builds successfully without errors\n3. **Application Testing**: Test all enhanced API integrations and monitoring functionality\n4. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Implement responsive design improvements for mobile devices (currently using `grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2` but may need additional mobile optimizations)\n5. **Performance Validation**: Verify that Web Vitals monitoring and Sentry integration are working correctly in production",
