  "text": "\n\nHello! I'm Claude Code, ready to help you with development tasks. I see from our conversation history that we've been working on a comprehensive form data persistence system for your Next.js project to prevent data loss during development.\n\nThe system we implemented includes 5 layers of protection:\n- IndexedDB storage (survives Clear-Site-Data headers)\n- Cookie-based backup with compression\n- Enhanced form storage orchestration\n- Real-time form guardian monitoring\n- Fixed middleware to preserve localStorage\n\nThe implementation is complete and building successfully. Is there anything specific you'd like to work on next, or would you like me to help with testing or further enhancements to the persistence system?",
