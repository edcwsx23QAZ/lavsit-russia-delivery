  "text": "## Conversation Summary\n\n**What We Did:**\n- Started a comprehensive project audit of a Next.js 14 application using a \"challenge protocol\" approach\n- Analyzed project structure including API routes, components, and documentation files\n- Identified key organizational issues in the project's rule system\n\n**Current Issue:**\nThe user encountered an **\"Error parsing tool data\"** that interrupted our audit process mid-stream.\n\n**Key Files We Were Examining:**\n- `project-rules.md` - Main project guidelines and technology stack rules\n- `.ideavorules` - Next.js 14 App Router technical specifications\n- `project.todo.md` - Project task list and priorities\n- `/app/diagnostic/page.tsx` - Project diagnostic interface\n- Various API routes in `/app/api/` directory\n\n**Issues Identified Before Error:**\n1. **Rule system fragmentation** - Duplicate rules between `.ideavorules` and `project-rules.md`\n2. **Incomplete documentation** - Files with placeholder content and missing integration\n3. **Organizational inconsistencies** - No clear hierarchy or integration between rule files\n\n**Current Status:**\n- **Blocked** by \"Error parsing tool data\" that needs resolution\n- Project audit **50% complete** - structure analyzed, but integration work pending\n- Ready to resume comprehensive cleanup once error is fixed\n\n**Immediate Next Steps:**\n1. **Debug the parsing error** - Need to identify root cause (likely JSON malformation, encoding issues, or file access problems)\n2. **Resume project audit** once error is resolved\n3. **Complete documentation integration** - Merge fragmented rule systems into coherent structure\n4. **Implement fixes** for organizational issues we identified\n\n**Priority:** Fix the parsing error blocking our audit workflow before continuing with the comprehensive project cleanup and documentation restructuring.",
