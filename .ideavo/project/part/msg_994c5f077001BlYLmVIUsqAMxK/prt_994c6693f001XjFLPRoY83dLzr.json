  "text": "Perfect! I've adjusted the initial 3D orientation so that the truck bed floor is parallel to the X-axis:\n\n## ✅ **Updated 3D Orientation:**\n\n### **Floor Parallel to X-Axis:**\n- **Rotation X: 0°** (no tilt - floor is perfectly horizontal/parallel to X-axis)\n- **Rotation Y: -45°** (classic isometric 3/4 view for optimal cargo visibility)\n- **Rotation Z: 0°** (no roll)\n\n### **Optimized Positioning:**\n- **Position Y: 50%** (centered vertically)\n- **Scale: 70%** (slightly larger for better cargo detail visibility)\n\n### **Benefits of This View:**\n1. **Clear cargo layout**: Floor parallel to X-axis makes it easy to see how cargo items are arranged\n2. **Isometric perspective**: Classic 3/4 view that's familiar and intuitive\n3. **Optimal for analysis**: Perfect for inspecting cargo placement efficiency\n4. **Easy measurement**: Horizontal floor makes dimensions easier to judge visually\n\n### **Reset Button Updated:**\n- Now resets to this new optimal demonstration angle\n- Provides consistent starting point for cargo analysis\n\n## 🚛 **Result:**\nThe truck now displays with the cargo bed floor running parallel to the X-axis, providing a clear, analytical view perfect for demonstrating and evaluating cargo placement efficiency. This orientation is ideal for logistics presentations and cargo optimization analysis!",
