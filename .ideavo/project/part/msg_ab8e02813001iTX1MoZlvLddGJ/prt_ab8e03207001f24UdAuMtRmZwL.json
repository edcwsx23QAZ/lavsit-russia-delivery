The connection string format might be incorrect or there could be network/firewall issues.\n\n**Current Status:**\n- The SaveCalculation button is visible in the UI\n- All components are properly integrated\n- The app runs successfully at localhost:3000\n- Database migration pending due to connection issues\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. **Database Connection**: Need to resolve the Supabase connection issue - the password might be incorrect or the connection format needs adjustment\n2. **Migration**: Once connected, run `npx prisma migrate dev --name add_calculations_table`\n3. **Testing**: Test the complete save functionality with screenshots\n\nThe UI integration is complete and ready. Once the database connection is resolved, the save functionality should work end-to-end.",
