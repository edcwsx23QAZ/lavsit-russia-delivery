  "text": "\nPerfect! Now I can see the issue clearly. There's an opening conditional at line 4880: `{calculations.length > 0 && (` which should close after the hidden companies block. But the structure is wrong because there's an extra `</div>` at line 5059 and the closing structure is mismatched.\n\nThe correct structure should be:\n```\n{calculations.length > 0 && (\n  <div className=\"space-y-2\">\n    // calculations results\n    // hidden companies block\n  </div>\n)}\n```\n\nBut currently it seems like there's an extra `</div>` and mismatched parentheses. Let me fix this by removing the extra `)}` at line 5079:",
