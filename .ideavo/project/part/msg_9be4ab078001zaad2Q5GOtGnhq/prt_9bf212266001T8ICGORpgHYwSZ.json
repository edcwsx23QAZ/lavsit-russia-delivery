  "text": "## Conversation Summary\n\n### What We Did\n1. **Created comprehensive manual testing suite** for transport companies:\n   - Built `ManualTesting.tsx` component with 44+ test cases covering all delivery variations\n   - Integrated persistent localStorage-based results tracking\n   - Added the component to diagnostic page as \"Ручное тестирование 2.0\"\n   - Created detailed documentation in `MANUAL_TESTING_GUIDE.md`\n\n2. **Investigated Dellin pricing discrepancy**:\n   - Found 500₽ difference between our app (6,088₽) vs official site (8,632₽) for packaging\n   - Identified root cause: different packaging UIDs being used\n   - Our app: `0xa6a7bd2bf950e67f4b2cf7cc3a97c111` (fallback due to API failure)\n   - Dellin site: `0x9dd8901b0ecef10c11e8ed001199bf6e` (official selection)\n\n### Current Problem\n**Dellin packaging API returns 401 errors**, forcing our app to use hardcoded fallback UID instead of getting actual packaging options from their services directory.\n\n### Files Modified\n- `components/diagnostic/ManualTesting.tsx` (NEW) - Manual testing interface\n- `app/diagnostic/page.tsx` - Added ManualTesting component\n- `docs/MANUAL_TESTING_GUIDE.md` (NEW) - Testing documentation\n\n### What We're Currently Investigating\n**API discrepancy analysis**: Comparing our Dellin API implementation against their official documentation for `request_services.json` endpoint to fix packaging UID retrieval.\n\n**Key Question**: Our current implementation uses `/api/dellin-packages` route which returns 401 errors. Need to verify if we're correctly implementing the official `https://api.dellin.ru/v1/public/request_services.json` endpoint as documented.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Fix Dellin packaging API** to get correct UIDs instead of fallback values\n2. **Compare API implementation** with official Dellin documentation \n3. **Test manual testing suite** with real pricing comparisons\n4. **Validate all transport company calculations** for accuracy within ±100₽ tolerance\n\nThe manual testing framework is now ready for systematic validation of all transport company pricing accuracy.",
