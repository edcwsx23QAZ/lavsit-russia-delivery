  "text": "## Conversation Summary\n\n**What Was Done:**\n- Initiated a comprehensive project audit using a \"challenge protocol\" methodology\n- Analyzed the Next.js 14 application structure and identified key organizational issues\n- Reviewed project documentation files and API route structure\n\n**Current Problem:**\nThe audit process was **interrupted by an \"Error parsing tool data\"** that needs immediate resolution before we can continue.\n\n**Files Being Examined:**\n- `project-rules.md` - Main project guidelines and tech stack rules\n- `.ideavorules` - Next.js 14 App Router technical specifications  \n- `project.todo.md` - Project task list and priorities\n- `/app/diagnostic/page.tsx` - Project diagnostic interface\n- Various API routes in `/app/api/` directory\n\n**Key Issues Identified:**\n1. **Rule system fragmentation** - Duplicate/conflicting rules between `.ideavorules` and `project-rules.md`\n2. **Incomplete documentation** - Placeholder content and missing integration between files\n3. **Organizational inconsistencies** - No clear hierarchy in the rule system\n\n**Current Status:**\n- **Blocked** by parsing error that must be fixed first\n- Project audit is **~50% complete** - structure analyzed, integration work pending\n- Ready to resume comprehensive cleanup once technical issue is resolved\n\n**Immediate Next Steps:**\n1. **Debug and resolve** the \"Error parsing tool data\" issue\n2. **Resume the project audit** once error is fixed\n3. **Consolidate documentation** - Merge fragmented rule systems into coherent structure\n4. **Implement organizational fixes** for the issues we identified\n\n**Priority:** Resolve the parsing error blocking our workflow, then continue with the comprehensive project documentation restructuring and cleanup.",
