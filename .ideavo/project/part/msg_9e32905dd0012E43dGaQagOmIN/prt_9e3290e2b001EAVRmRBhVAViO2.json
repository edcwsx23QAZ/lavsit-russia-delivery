  "text": "I see that `requestData` is defined at line 3468, and the error return is at line 3486. So it should be in scope. But the TypeScript error says it's not. Maybe the issue is that the error return is inside a block where requestData is not accessible. Let me check the structure. Actually, looking at the code, the requestData is defined before the API call, so it should be in scope. Let me try a different approach - let me change `requestData,` to `requestData: requestData,` to be explicit.",
