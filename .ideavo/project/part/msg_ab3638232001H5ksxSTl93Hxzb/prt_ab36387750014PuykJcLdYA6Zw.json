  "text": "Now I can see the issue. Looking at the code, the `parseCalculationDetails` function ends at line 4450 with `};`, and then there's a blank line, and then the loading check starts at line 4452.\n\n\n## Examining Code Structure  \n- The `parseCalculationDetails` function concludes at line 4450 with a closing brace (`}`), marking the end of its definition.  \n- A blank line follows, creating a clear separation before the next section begins at line 4452, likely related to a loading check.\n\n## Investigating Error Location  \n- The error occurs at line 4465, with the message \"Unexpected token `div`. Expected jsx identifier,\" suggesting a syntax issue in the return statement's JSX.  \n- Line 4465 starts with `<div className=\"min-h-screen bg-gray-900 text-white p-4 relative\">`, which appears syntactically correct but may indicate an unclosed brace or parenthesis earlier.",
