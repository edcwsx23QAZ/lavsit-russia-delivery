  "text": "\n\n**Current State:** Bug fixes complete, ready for testing phase.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\nWe've successfully fixed the critical multiple cargo handling bugs in your logistics calculator! The main issues were that Rail Continent and Nord Wheel weren't properly handling multiple cargo pieces - they were treating quantities of 50+ items as single pieces. \n\n**Key fixes implemented:**\n- ✅ **Enhanced Rail Continent integration** with proper quantity parameter and smart dimensional calculations\n- ✅ **Improved Nord Wheel integration** with missing dimensional parameters and oversized cargo detection  \n- ✅ **Added comprehensive validation** for multiple cargo scenarios with warnings for edge cases\n- ✅ **Smart calculation logic** that adapts based on whether you have 1 piece, a few pieces, or many pieces\n\nThe system now properly handles everything from single oversized items to bulk shipments of 100+ pieces. Ready for testing!",
