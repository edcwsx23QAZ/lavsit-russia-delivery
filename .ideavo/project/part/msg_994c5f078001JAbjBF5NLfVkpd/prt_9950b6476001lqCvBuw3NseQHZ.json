  "text": "## Conversation Summary\n\n### What We Did\n**Built an advanced interactive 3D truck cargo visualization system** with comprehensive controls and realistic truck modeling. The project evolved from a basic 3D cargo placement algorithm to a full-featured interactive visualization.\n\n### Key Implementations Completed\n1. **3D Cargo Placement Algorithm**: Smart sorting (chairs first, then by weight/volume), collision detection, weight/stacking rules enforcement\n2. **Interactive 3D Controls**: \n   - Joystick for smooth X/Y rotation control\n   - Sliders for positioning (X,Y), scaling, and Z-rotation\n   - Reset button for default view\n3. **Complete Truck Model**: Added cabin (green), chassis (dark gray), and wheels to provide full vehicle context\n4. **Enhanced Cargo Legend**: Shows first two words of product names (e.g., \"Груз №1 'Стул Эрвин'\")\n\n### Current File Being Modified\n**`/components/TruckVisualization.tsx`** - The main 3D visualization component with full interactive controls\n\n### What We Just Fixed\n**Orientation optimization**: Adjusted the initial 3D view to show the truck with:\n- **Floor parallel to X-axis** (rotationX: 0°) for clear cargo layout analysis\n- **Isometric 3/4 view** (rotationY: -45°) for optimal visualization\n- **Centered positioning** with 70% scale for better visibility\n- **Updated reset button** to match new default values\n\n### Current Status\nThe system is **fully functional** with:\n- Smart 3D cargo placement algorithm\n- Complete interactive controls (joystick + sliders)\n- Realistic truck model with cabin, chassis, wheels\n- Optimized viewing angle with floor parallel to X-axis\n- Professional cargo legend with product names\n\n### What Could Be Done Next\n**Potential enhancements** (if requested):\n- Additional visualization modes (top-down, side view)\n- Export/save functionality for cargo arrangements\n- Weight distribution analysis visualization\n- Animation of cargo loading sequence\n- Performance optimizations for larger cargo sets\n\n### Technical Context\nThe component uses 3D matrix transformations with orthographic projection. The current viewing angle provides an ideal demonstration perspective for cargo placement analysis and logistics presentations.",
