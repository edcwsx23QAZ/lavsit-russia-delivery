  "text": "\nInteresting! The error moved to line 4466, which means the issue is not with the `return` statement itself, but with the JSX that follows. The parser is expecting a JSX identifier but finding `div` instead, which suggests there's a structural issue with how the JSX is structured.\n\nThis tells me that there's likely an unmatched opening brace or parenthesis somewhere before this line that's causing the parser to be in the wrong context. Let me restore the return statement and look for the real issue:",
