  "text": "\nI can see that line 5058 has `))}` which closes the `.filter().map()` chain, and line 5059 has `</div>` which closes the calculations container. \n\nThe issue is that the conditional from line 4880 `{calculations.length > 0 && (` should encompass both the calculations results AND the hidden companies block. But currently, the hidden companies block is outside that conditional.\n\nThe correct structure should be:\n```\n{calculations.length > 0 && (\n  <div className=\"space-y-2\">\n    // calculations results (lines 4881-5059)\n    // hidden companies block (lines 5061-5078)\n  </div>\n)}\n```\n\nBut currently the hidden companies block starts after the `</div>` at line 5059, which breaks the structure. I need to move the hidden companies block inside the conditional.\n\nLet me fix this by moving the hidden companies block inside the calculations conditional:",
