  "text": "## Conversation Summary\n\n### **What We Did**\n- **Fixed critical hydration error** by adding loading state check (`if (!isLoaded)`) to prevent server/client rendering mismatch\n- **Added 17 new transport companies** to the existing 5, bringing total to 22 companies with unique icons and API keys\n- **Implemented toggle switches** for all transport companies in the \"Подключенные транспортные компании\" block\n- **Added version management system** to automatically clear localStorage when app updates (v2.0.0)\n- **Enhanced debugging** with console logs and counters to track company rendering\n\n### **Files We Worked On**\n- **`app/page.tsx`** - Main application file containing:\n  - `COMPANIES_BASE` array (expanded from 5 to 22 companies)\n  - `enabledCompanies` state with all 22 company toggles\n  - `apiStatus` state for tracking connection status\n  - Version management in `useEffect` hook\n  - Debug logging for troubleshooting\n\n### **Current Issue**\n**Caching Problem**: New transport companies (22 total) are not displaying in the ideavo preview or local browser, despite successful build. The code is correct but cached versions are being served.\n\n### **What We're Currently Working On**\n**Resolving browser/preview caching** so that all 22 transport companies display immediately without requiring incognito mode or manual cache clearing.\n\n### **Technical Details**\n- **Total companies**: 22 (5 active APIs + 17 new additions)\n- **Version system**: Implemented `v2.0.0` with localStorage clearing\n- **Debug indicators**: Added company count to page title and section headers\n- **Build status**: ✅ Successful compilation, no errors\n\n### **What Needs to Be Done Next**\n1. **Resolve caching issue** for ideavo preview to show updated content\n2. **Verify all 22 companies display** with correct toggle functionality\n3. **Test switch states** work properly for enabled/disabled companies\n4. **Consider implementing APIs** for the new transport companies when needed\n\n### **Current State**\n- Code is complete and correct\n- Build succeeds without errors\n- Issue is purely browser/preview caching preventing new content from displaying\n- Need solution for automatic preview updates in ideavo environment\n\nThe functionality is implemented correctly but requires cache resolution to be visible in the preview environment.",
