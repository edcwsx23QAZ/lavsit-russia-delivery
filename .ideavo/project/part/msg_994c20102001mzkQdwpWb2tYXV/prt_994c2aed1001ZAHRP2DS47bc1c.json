  "text": "Perfect! I've fixed the initial positioning of the 3D truck model:\n\n## ✅ **Fixed Initial Position:**\n\n### **Proper Rear 3/4 View:**\n- **Rotation X: -15°** (slight upward tilt to see the truck from above)\n- **Rotation Y: -135°** (rotated to show rear 3/4 view)\n- **Rotation Z: 0°** (no roll)\n\n### **Standing on Wheels:**\n- **Position Y: 70%** (moved down so truck sits properly on wheels)\n- **Scale: 65%** (increased size for better visibility)\n\n### **Updated Reset Button:**\n- Now resets to the correct rear 3/4 view position\n- All default values match the improved initial position\n\n## 🚛 **Result:**\nThe truck now appears in a natural **rear 3/4 view** where you can see:\n- The back and right side of the truck\n- The truck properly standing on its wheels (not sideways)\n- Good view of the cargo bed from behind\n- Proper proportional sizing for easy viewing\n\nThe model now starts in the optimal position for inspecting cargo placement from the rear of the truck, which is the most practical viewpoint for loading operations!",
