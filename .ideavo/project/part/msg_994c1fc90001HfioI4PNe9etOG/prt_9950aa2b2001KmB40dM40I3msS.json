  "text": "## Conversation Summary\n\n### What We Did\n**Built an advanced interactive 3D truck cargo visualization system** with comprehensive controls and realistic truck modeling. The project evolved from a basic 3D cargo placement algorithm to a full-featured interactive visualization.\n\n### Key Implementations Completed\n1. **3D Cargo Placement Algorithm**: Smart sorting (chairs first, then by weight/volume), collision detection, weight/stacking rules enforcement\n2. **Interactive 3D Controls**: \n   - Joystick for smooth X/Y rotation control\n   - Sliders for positioning (X,Y), scaling, and Z-rotation\n   - Reset button for default view\n3. **Complete Truck Model**: Added cabin (green), chassis (dark gray), and wheels to provide full vehicle context\n4. **Enhanced Cargo Legend**: Shows first two words of product names (e.g., \"Груз №1 'Стул Эрвин'\")\n\n### Current File Being Modified\n**`/components/TruckVisualization.tsx`** - The main 3D visualization component with full interactive controls\n\n### Current Issue to Fix\n**Model orientation problem**: The truck is currently positioned sideways instead of showing the proper rear 3/4 view with the truck standing on its wheels. The initial rotation values need adjustment to show:\n- Rear 3/4 perspective view\n- Truck properly standing on wheels (not on its side)\n- Proper orientation for intuitive cargo loading visualization\n\n### What Needs to Be Done Next\n**Adjust initial rotation values** in the component state to fix the default viewing angle:\n- Modify `rotationX`, `rotationY`, `rotationZ` initial values\n- Ensure truck appears in standard rear 3/4 view\n- Verify wheels are touching the ground plane\n- Test that cargo placement still works correctly with new orientation\n\n### Technical Context\nThe component uses 3D matrix transformations with X/Y/Z rotation applied in sequence, then projects to 2D using orthographic projection with perspective. The rotation state controls the viewing angle, and the current default values (rotationX: 15°, rotationY: 25°, rotationZ: 0°) are producing an incorrect orientation.",
