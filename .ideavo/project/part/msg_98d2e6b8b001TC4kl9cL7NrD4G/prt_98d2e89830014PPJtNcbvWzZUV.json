  "text": "I can see this is a Google Sheets document containing furniture product data with shipping dimensions and weights. The table has columns for:\n\n- ID, External Code, Activity status, Product name, Retail price\n- Multiple shipping places (Место 1-7) with weight, height, depth, and length for each\n\nFrom what I can observe, this appears to be furniture products (sofas, beds, tables, etc.) with their shipping characteristics. Each product can have multiple shipping packages (up to 7 places) with specific dimensions.\n\nTo work with this data in your logistics calculator, I would need to:\n\n1. **Extract and structure the data** - Parse the shipping dimensions for each product\n2. **Convert to a usable format** - Transform into JSON or another format your calculator can use\n3. **Integrate with the testing system** - Use real product data instead of generated test data\n\nHowever, I'm currently in read-only mode and cannot make modifications. When you're ready to proceed, I can help you:\n\n- **Parse this furniture data** into structured shipping information\n- **Create realistic test scenarios** using actual product dimensions from your catalog\n- **Update the testing system** to use real-world shipping scenarios\n- **Generate comprehensive reports** based on your actual product mix\n\nThe data shows products ranging from small decorative pillows (26x26 cm) to large modular sofas (325x172 cm), which would provide excellent test coverage for your logistics calculator across all size categories.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with extracting and structuring this data for use in your logistics testing system?",
