  "text": "Now I have the full API documentation for NordWheel. Let me analyze what I found:\n\n\n## Reviewing API Documentation\n- Found the NordWheel API documentation, starting with the City List API.\n- The `/api/v1/city-list` endpoint returns cities, including \"guid\" and \"name\" fields.\n\n## Reviewing API Documentation  \n- The Calculate API uses `city_fias` in the location object, which corresponds to the FIAS code from the City List API.  \n- The Terminals API, at `/api/v1/terminals?city_id=<fias_code>`, returns terminals for a city based on its FIAS code.  \n\n## Checking Field Consistency  \n- The City List API documentation shows \"guid\" as the FIAS code, but testing revealed the API returns a \"fias\" field instead.  \n- This suggests a potential inconsistency or recent change in the API, as the Calculate API expects \"city_fias\" matching the \"guid\" from City List.\n\n## Reviewing API Documentation  \n- The Cities API response shows \"fias\" instead of \"guid,\" contradicting the documentation, which may indicate an update.  \n- For terminal type, the Calculate API uses \"city_fias,\" but testing suggests issues with city lookup, possibly due to invalid FIAS codes.  \n\n## Investigating API Errors  \n- Error \"Attempt to read property 'city_type_id' on null\" suggests city lookup failure, potentially due to NordWheel's system not recognizing provided FIAS codes.  \n- Using Moscow and St.",
