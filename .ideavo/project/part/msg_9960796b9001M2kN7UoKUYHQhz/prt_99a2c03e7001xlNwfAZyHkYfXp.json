  "text": "## Conversation Summary\n\n### What We Did\n1. **Successfully implemented save functionality** for vehicle types on the Diagnostic page:\n   - Added \"Сохранить\" button in the header with status indicators\n   - Implemented localStorage-based persistence with loading/saving\n   - Added visual feedback for unsaved changes and save status\n   - Created automatic data restoration on page load\n\n2. **Optimized TruckVisualization layout** to eliminate horizontal scrolling:\n   - Combined \"Управление 3D моделью\" and \"Тип автомобиля\" controls into one horizontal row\n   - Made layout responsive with `flex-col lg:flex-row`\n   - Reduced element sizes, padding, and text to be more compact\n   - Shortened labels to \"Управление\" and \"Авто\" for space efficiency\n\n3. **Updated button styling** on Diagnostic page:\n   - Changed \"Проверить переменные окружения\" and \"Закрыть\" buttons to black text on white background\n\n4. **Reverted recent changes** - The last two commits were rolled back per user request\n\n### Current State\n- **Primary file:** `/components/TruckVisualization.tsx` - Contains optimized compact layout without horizontal scrolling\n- **Secondary file:** `/app/diagnostic/page.tsx` - Has save functionality for vehicle types management\n- **Status:** All functionality working, build successful, horizontal scrolling eliminated\n\n### Files We're Working On\n- `/components/TruckVisualization.tsx` - Main 3D visualization component with optimized controls\n- `/app/diagnostic/page.tsx` - Diagnostic page with vehicle type management and save features\n\n### Technical Context\n- Using Next.js 14 App Router with TypeScript\n- Tailwind CSS for styling with responsive design patterns\n- localStorage for data persistence\n- Dynamic vehicle type system affecting 3D calculations\n- No database integration - using client-side state management\n\n### What's Ready for Next Steps\n- Compact, responsive UI without horizontal overflow\n- Fully functional save system for vehicle data\n- Clean, optimized component structure\n- All builds passing without errors\n\nThe conversation successfully resolved the horizontal scrolling issue through strategic layout optimization while maintaining all existing functionality.",
