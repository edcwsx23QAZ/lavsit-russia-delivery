  "text": "## Conversation Summary\n\n### What We Did\n1. **Implemented anti-caching system** across multiple layers to ensure immediate updates in ideavo preview\n2. **Encountered webpack module loading error** - `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')`\n3. **First fix attempt**: Removed webpack cache configuration and experimental settings from `next.config.js`\n4. **Build/dev server works locally** but error persists in ideavo preview\n\n### Current Problem\n**Persistent webpack runtime error** in ideavo preview environment:\n- Error occurs at `options.factory` in webpack.js (715:31) \n- Related to React Server Components and lazy component mounting\n- Suggests module factory is undefined during webpack module loading\n- Error persists despite removing problematic webpack configurations\n\n### Files Currently Being Modified\n1. **`next.config.js`** - Simplified configuration, removed experimental and webpack settings\n2. **Other anti-cache files intact**: `middleware.ts`, `app/page.tsx`, `app/layout.tsx`, `components/ClientDevUtils.tsx`, `components/ServiceWorkerRegistration.tsx`\n\n### Current Status\n✅ **Local development works** - build and dev server run without errors  \n❌ **Ideavo preview fails** - webpack module factory error persists  \n🔄 **Need deeper investigation** into module loading/chunking issues\n\n### What We're Going to Do Next\n1. **Investigate the specific component** causing the lazy loading failure\n2. **Check for dynamic imports** or code-splitting issues in our components\n3. **Potentially revert anti-cache changes systematically** to isolate the problematic modification\n4. **Consider environment-specific webpack behavior** differences between local dev and ideavo preview\n\nThe issue appears to be related to how webpack handles module loading in the ideavo preview environment specifically, possibly due to our anti-cache modifications affecting module resolution or chunking.",
