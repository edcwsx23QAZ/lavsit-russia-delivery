  "text": "## Conversation Summary: Freight Calculator Application Development\n\n### What Was Done:\n1. **Initial Setup & Core Integrations**: Built a Next.js 14 freight calculator with modular API routes for transport companies (TK).\n2. **API Integrations**: Successfully integrated Vozovoz, SDEK, and KIT APIs with OAuth authentication, error handling, and performance monitoring.\n3. **UI/UX Improvements**: Enhanced SDEK tariff selection logic, added detailed cost breakdowns, improved mobile responsiveness.\n4. **Code Quality**: Fixed TypeScript errors, optimized bundle size, implemented proper error boundaries and retry mechanisms.\n5. **Testing & Monitoring**: Added Jest unit tests, Cypress E2E tests, and Sentry for error tracking and performance monitoring.\n\n### What Is Currently Being Worked On:\n- **Implementing Comprehensive Improvements**: Following the detailed plan for 20 critical enhancements, focusing on the 5 prioritized areas (monitoring/logging, performance optimization, testing, UI/UX redesign, mobile adaptation, and external API creation).\n- **Moving Tests & Monitoring to Diagnostic Page**: Relocating all testing infrastructure and monitoring dashboards to the existing `/diagnostic` page for centralized management.\n\n### Which Files Are Being Modified:\n- **Core Application**: `app/page.tsx` (main calculator logic), `app/api/` routes for TK integrations\n- **Diagnostic Page**: `app/diagnostic/page.tsx` (adding test suites and monitoring panels)\n- **Components**: `components/diagnostic/` folder (expanding with new test and monitoring components)\n- **Configuration**: `lib/env-config.ts`, `package.json` (adding new dependencies)\n- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS files for UI/UX improvements\n\n### What Needs to Be Done Next:\n1. **Complete Test Migration**: Move Jest/Cypress tests to diagnostic page with real-time status indicators.\n2. **Implement Monitoring Dashboard**: Add Sentry integration and performance metrics visualization to diagnostic page.\n3. **UI/UX Redesign**: Implement modern design system with animations and improved navigation.\n4. **Mobile Optimization**: Enhance touch interactions and PWA features.\n5. **External API Development**: Create REST API endpoints for third-party integrations.\n6. **Production Deployment**: Set up CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and monitoring.\n7. **Performance Optimization**: Implement code splitting, lazy loading, and bundle optimization.\n8. **Security Hardening**: Add rate limiting, CSRF protection, and input validation.\n9. **Documentation**: Create API documentation and user guides.\n10. **Scalability Planning**: Implement caching, database integration, and load balancing for future growth.",
